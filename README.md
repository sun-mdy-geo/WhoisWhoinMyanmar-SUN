ABSTRACT
The country of Myanmar is also known as Burma, and the two names are
often confuse. It consists of 14 provinces: 7 states representing the areas
of 7 main ethnic races and 7 divisions. The purpose of project is to know
readily and inexpensively about Myanmar’s people such as Parliament,
Writers, Directors, Actors and Singers.
On our websites, you can read the information contained on the page, and
if there are any interesting hyperlinks, you can follow those links to find
more information or to perform a task. This could lead to save times and
costs for the people who interested about Myanmar’s people.
For admin Panel, admins can insert, data into database, delete and retrieve
data for database. Users can use our system with both smart phones and
computers. For Front End, the system was implemented using material
design (HTML, CSS). For Back End, this system was implemented using
JavaScript and jQuery. The project will be implemented using Flask with
Python and deploy on Heroku (CLI).
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I would like to deeply thanks my supervisor, Dr. Lwin Mar Thin, Associdate
Professor, Hardware Technology Department, University of Computer
Studies (Mandalay), for her helpful advice and close guidance throughout
this project.
Then respectfully thanks to U Ravi Chhabra, CEO of Geo Mandalar IT
Co.Ltd, for his invaluable suggestions, patient comments and detailed
technical contribution.
I also thank all my teachers from University of Computer Studies
(Mandalay), especially, our rector U Kyaw Zwa Soe , our pro-rector Dr. San
San Tin and our teacher Dr. Aye Aye Chaw. I would like to gratefully thank
my friends and my dearest parents who have always given great help and
support through my life.

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1 Introduction
A web page is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web
browsers. To view a web page requires a browser (e.g., Internet Explorer,
Safari, Firefox, or Chrome). A web browser displays a web page on a
monitor or mobile device. Web pages usually include information such as
the colors of text and backgrounds and very often contain links to images
and sometimes other types of media to be included in the final view.
The project provides us the complete and accurate information about the
Parliament, Writers, Directors, Actors and Singers who are in Myanmar by
the webpages.
The project named “Who is Who in Myanmar” is aimed to widely u
Agile Model can apply functional process of developing project rapidly and
it is flexible model for developers. Backbone of Agile model is client
communication, so if client does not understand what is meant to; the
development team can be forward to the wrong direction. Technique I have
to need to design the business process notations and make diagrams for
the design in the project area.
1.2.2 What is Flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a
micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It
has no database abstraction layer, from validation, or any other
components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common
function. However, Flask supports extensions that can add applications
features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
1.2.3 What is a Database?
A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be
easily accessed, managed and updated.
Data is organized into rows, columns and tables, and it is indexed to make
it easier to find relevant information. Data gets updated, expanded and
deleted as new information is added. The Firebase Real-time Database is a
cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime
to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with
our iOS, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime
Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest
data. Computer database typically contain aggregations of data records or
files, such as attendance transactions, attendance percentage and reports.
1.3 Objectives of the Project
• To help for searching people who is who in Myanmar more efficient than
ever
• To convey helpful information to specific users
• To provide the ability for making changes to the site’s information easily
for the operator
• To replace uncomfortable paper system by modern webpages
•To save times and costs
1.4 Scope of Proposed System
The proposed project of Who is Who in Myanmar is prescribed as follow;
Manage Home, Political, Writer, Director, Actor, Singer, Help, Features,
methodology and FAQ.
• View Home
• View Political
• View Writer
• View Director
• View Actor
• View Singer
• View Help
CHAPTER 2
MEHDOLOGY
2.1 Requirement Analysis
The description of the services and constraints are the requirements for
the system. Requirement analysis is the process of deriving the system
requirements through observation of existing system, discussions with
potential users and procurers, task analysis.
2.2 Software Selection
Chosen Programming Language
I would like to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, material design lite in
my project because there are a lot of benefits to pick up languages in our
window form application.
• HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup.
• CSS can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. It describes
how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other
media.
• JavaScript is a high-level and interpreted programming language.
• JQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
• Material Design Lite makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts,
responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as
lighting and shadows.
• They are readily available and easy to access.
Software Requirements
• Gitbash
• Pycharm Community
• Heroku
• Github
• Flask with Python
Hardware Requirements
• Internet Access
• PC with windows OS
2.3 Project Plan
In understanding the system requirements and testing some features, we
work together. UI/UX, Developer, testing and documentation, we work
together. User Access Level/ Access to Pages, project Manager and System
Analysis are discussed about the systems to understand the user.
CHAPTER 3
EVALUATION AND CONCLUSION
3.1 Conclusion
The app provide a great convenience for all users. Users could get all
information that they are interested in at once without moving from site to
site.
All people who are famous in Myanmar are collected and presented in the
app. In which app including common facts about celebrities, writers,
business men and also even politicians.
The app’s contents are human readable form and navigate you to the
information store you want to know. It can be accessed from both mobile
phones and computers with internet access. Moreover, up to date people’s
news are provided for users at any given time.
3.2 Advantages of the Project
The proposed system offers the following advantages:
• It provides “faster and better” services to visitors.
• This is helpful in assessing what’s in progress, what has written, the
writing style, how it was structured, research methods, and which
reference were used.
• User can satisfy because they can search not only thesis title but also by
year, supervisor name.
• Assisting postgraduate students to write.
• Provide facility for proper monitoring, reduces paper work and provide
data security.
3.3 Disadvantages
• The cost of computer hardware and software programs can be expensive.
• As mobile tablets use wireless network, they can disconnect with network
if Wi Fi fails.
3.4 Further Extensions
This application has incompleteness from various view-points. But if it is
continuously developed with experts, current needs will be covered shortly,
then the effectiveness will approve its property. Various functionalities can
be embedded within the application.
